# YNAB-Excel
A template for excel based upon the old YNAB system

This is designed to simulate the original YNAB structure set up. They stopped holding support for the 32-bit software on iOS, so I decided to take their idea and mould it into a excel spreadsheet so that anyone can use it. Unfortunately it doesn't look as sleek as their 32-bit app, but the functionality should be good. 
This would be difficult to use unless you are familiar with the old YNAB, in any case, have a go! You might save some ca$h.

N.B.
a) Please only add your details into the Transactions pages. The rest of the sheet should update automatically.
b) Leave 'Accounts' and 'Reports' cells alone!
c) On the 'Budget' sheet, only add values to the Budgeted column


To effectively use this sheet, please follow these instructions :

i) Change category names to ones that will suit you
ii) Add how many accounts you have by duplicating (need to add functionality so that when a new sheet is added it adds to large accounts)
